# Pneumonia-Detection-Classifier
This repository presents a deep learning solution for automated pneumonia detection from chest X-ray images using a custom Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) built with PyTorch. The model is trained on a custom, imbalanced dataset, utilising techniques to mitigate class imbalance and enhance diagnostic accuracy.
